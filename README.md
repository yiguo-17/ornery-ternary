# Ornery Ternary

Do not use `if` for any of the below!

1. Write a function called `isHot` that returns the string `'Yes, it is indeed hot.'` if the temperature is at or above 80, and the string `'No, it is not hot.'` otherwise.
2. Write a function called `helloThere` that returns a short greeting given a name with more than 5 characters and a longer greeting given a name of 5 characters or fewer. The short greeting should be the string 'Hi' and the given name, separated by a comma and a space. The long greeting should be the string 'Hello' and the given name, separated by a comma and a space.
3. Write a function called `goodbyeYou` that, given a name, returns the string `Goodbye` followed by the name, with a comma and space in between. If no name is given, substitute the string `'stranger'` for their name.
